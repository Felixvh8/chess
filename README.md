## Chess

This is a chess program that is being worked upon by myself. It is the second time I have attempted to make a chess engine, the first being written poorly with bad programming practices. This attempt has made several improvements and is significantly easier to read.

The program uses HTML5 and CSS to run graphics for the Javascript based engine. My personal goal of this program is to create a chess bot with a chess rating of 500.
